<h1>Litany Against Fear</h1>
	<p>
I must not fear.<br/>
Fear is the mind-killer.<br/>
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br/><br/>
I will face my fear.<br/>
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br/><br/>
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br/>
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.<br/>
